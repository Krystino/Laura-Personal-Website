    <h1>Hi, I'm Laura</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate educator and lifelong learner currently diving into the world of educational innovation at
      UNC-Chapel Hill through the MEITE program. With three years of hands-on teaching experience, I’ve found real
      purpose in blending education with technology to make learning accessible, impactful, and, most importantly,
      engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I’ve developed a fascination with statistics, seeing it as a tool not just for insights but for crafting
      better experiences in education. I’m here to connect with others who are excited about rethinking how we teach and
      learn, and I’d love to chat about ideas, insights, or collaborations that make a difference!
    </p>
